	abstract = {Objectives  We validate a machine learning-based sepsis-prediction algorithm (InSight) for the detection and prediction of three sepsis-related gold standards, using only six vital signs. We evaluate robustness to missing data, customisation to site-specific data using transfer learning and generalisability to new settings. Design  A machine-learning algorithm with gradient tree boosting. Features for prediction were created from combinations of six vital sign measurements and their changes over time. Setting  A mixed-ward retrospective dataset from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Medical Center (San Francisco, California, USA) as the primary source, an intensive care unit dataset from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, Massachusetts, USA) as a transfer-learning source and four additional institutions’ datasets to evaluate generalisability. Participants  684 443 total encounters, with 90 353 encounters from June 2011 to March 2016 at UCSF. Interventions None. Primary and secondary outcome measures  Area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve for detection and prediction of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock.
Results  For detection of sepsis and severe sepsis, InSight achieves an AUROC curve of 0.92 (95\% CI 0.90 to 0.93) and 0.87 (95\% CI 0.86 to 0.88), respectively. Four hours before onset, InSight predicts septic shock with an AUROC of 0.96 (95\% CI 0.94 to 0.98) and severe sepsis with an AUROC of 0.85 (95\% CI 0.79 to 0.91).
Conclusions  InSight outperforms existing sepsis scoring systems in identifying and predicting sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. This is the first sepsis screening system to exceed an AUROC of 0.90 using only vital sign inputs. InSight is robust to missing data, can be customised to novel hospital data using a small fraction of site data and retains strong discrimination across all institutions.},

The consensus sepsis definitions have permitted worldwide epidemiological studies of sepsis to be conducted. We now recognize the common nature of sepsis and the consistency of its disease – particularly severe sepsis and septic shock. The incidence of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock continues to increase, and although Gram-positive bacterial pathogens remain the most common cause of sepsis, fungal organisms are increasing rapidly. We have made progress over the past half-century in identifying and treating patients with sepsis, and decreasing fatality rates reflect this progress. However, owing to the increasing incidence of sepsis, the number of people who die each year continues to increase. The mortality with sepsis, particularly related to treating organ dysfunction, remains a priority to clinicians worldwide and is deserving of greater public health attention.},

	abstract = {Measurements: Annual national incidence and in-hospital mortality of severe sepsis.
Results: The average annual incidence varied by as much as 3.5-fold depending on method used and ranged from 894,013 (300/100,000 population) to 3,110,630 (1,031/100,000) using the methods of Dombrovskiy et al and Wang et al, respectively. Average annual increase in the incidence of severe sepsis was similar (13.0\% to 13.3\%) across all methods. In-hospital mortality ranged from 14.7\% to 29.9\% using abstraction methods of Wang et al and Dombrovskiy et al. Using all methods, there was a decrease in in-hospital mortality across the 6-year period (35.2\% to 25.6\% [Dombrovskiy et al] and 17.8\% to 12.1\% [Wang et al]). Use of ICD-9 sepsis codes more than doubled over the 6-year period (158,722 – 489,632 [995.92 severe sepsis], 131,719 –303,615 [785.52 septic shock]).
Conclusion: There is substantial variability in incidence and mortality of severe sepsis depending on the method of database abstraction used. A uniform, consistent method is needed for use in national registries to facilitate accurate assessment of clinical interventions and outcome comparisons between hospitals and regions.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence, underlying causes, and preventability of sepsis-associated mortality in acute care hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cohort study in which a retrospective medical record review was conducted of 568 randomly selected adults admitted to 6 US academic and community hospitals from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015, who died in the hospital or were discharged to hospice and not readmitted. Medical records were reviewed from January 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinicians reviewed cases for sepsis during hospitalization using Sepsis-3 criteria, hospice-qualifying criteria on admission, immediate and underlying causes of death, and suboptimal sepsis-related care such as inappropriate or delayed antibiotics, inadequate source control, or other medical errors. The preventability of each sepsis-associated death was rated on a 6-point Likert scale.
RESULTS The study cohort included 568 patients (289 [50.9\%] men; mean [SD] age, 70.5 [16.1] years) who died in the hospital or were discharged to hospice. Sepsis was present in 300 hospitalizations (52.8\%; 95\% CI, 48.6\%-57.0\%) and was the immediate cause of death in 198 cases (34.9\%; 95\% CI, 30.9\%-38.9\%). The next most common immediate causes of death were progressive cancer (92 [16.2\%]) and heart failure (39 [6.9\%]). The most common underlying causes of death in patients with sepsis were solid cancer (63 of 300 [21.0\%]), chronic heart disease (46 of 300 [15.3\%]), hematologic cancer (31 of 300 [10.3\%]), dementia (29 of 300 [9.7\%]), and chronic lung disease (27 of 300 [9.0\%]). Hospice-qualifying conditions were present on admission in 121 of 300 sepsis-associated deaths (40.3\%; 95\% CI 34.7\%-46.1\%), most commonly end-stage cancer. Suboptimal care, most commonly delays in antibiotics, was identified in 68 of 300 sepsis-associated deaths (22.7\%). However, only 11 sepsis-associated deaths (3.7\%) were judged definitely or moderately likely preventable; another 25 sepsis-associated deaths (8.3\%) were considered possibly preventable.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cohort from 6 US hospitals, sepsis was the most common immediate cause of death. However, most underlying causes of death were related to severe chronic comorbidities and most sepsis-associated deaths were unlikely to be preventable through better hospital-based care. Further innovations in the prevention and care of underlying conditions may be necessary before a major reduction in sepsis-associated deaths can be achieved.},

@article{keLightGBMHighlyEfficient,
	title = {{LightGBM}: {A} {Highly} {Efficient} {Gradient} {Boosting} {Decision} {Tree}},
	abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efﬁciency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a signiﬁcant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that ﬁnding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},
