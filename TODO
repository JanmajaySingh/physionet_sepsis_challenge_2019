    ** Train a number of classifiers with different lookbacks. On the training set evaluate the best performing lookback
    over a window of timepoints, use the best lookback window for the set of timepoints

    !** Setup again predicting 1s to end if score > thresh. ALSO could do if t > T predict 1.

    !** Remove values > 95%-ile replace with median. See if helps.

    ** Consider each SOFA component separately and the paths of each.

    ** Compute the signature over lookback windows t=4 to 24, then take the max value of any signature terms over all
    window sizes

    !** For longtime t > 40, add baslines to the most important features

    !** Add the rolling mean of SBP over the last 6 hours / 3hours as a possible smoothing mechanism

    ** Use 2 gap leadlag

    ** Feature selection (use boruta) on the 0-1 labelled (eventual vs not) data. Then save the features and use in full
    algo.
